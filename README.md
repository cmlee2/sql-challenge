# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with doing a research project on people employed by a fictional company during the 1980s and 1990s. CSV files were provided as the remains of the employee database. CSV files were imported into an SQL database and various questions about the data were answered using SQL queries.

Using Data Modeling, Data Engineering and Data Analysis, various questions were answered about the data in question.
